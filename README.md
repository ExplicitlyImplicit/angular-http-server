# Angular-HTTP-Server

Rationale
=========

Very simple server that returns a file if it exists, or 'index.html' otherwise (i.e. when the url is a route).

Other simple http-servers (correctly) give a 404 when you try to refresh a page that is a route on a client side app

To use:
=======
```
cd /path/to/site
angular-http-server
```
Turn your browser to `localhost:8080`.
