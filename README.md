# Angular-HTTP-Server
## Simple HTTP server for developing sites that use client side routing

Very simple server that returns a file if it exists, or 'index.html' otherwise (i.e. when the url is a route).

Other http-servers give a 404 when you try to refresh a page that is a route on a client side app

To use: `angular-http-server` from the root directory you want to serve, and turn your browser to `localhost:8080`.
